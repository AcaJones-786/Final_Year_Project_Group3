# Setting up your dev enviroment

    Ensure your Git project is up to date.
        - Open VScode integrated terminal 
            -type "git pull origin"

    Install python3. 
        - If you are not comfortable using the command line and have a windows machine, Search Python in the Microsoft Store

    Install the python exstention to VSCode

    Open the integrated terminal in VSCode
        - Confirm whether python is installed by typing in "python3 --version"
            - You might be required to restart your operating system.
    
        - Set up your python virtual enviroment in windows
            In the integrated terminal:
            - Type "python3 -m venv venv"
                on some systems it might be "python -m venv venv"
            - ".\venv\Scripts\activate"
                windows might be blocking running scripts, if that is the case:
                    - Open windows powershell as Administrator
                        - Type "set-executionpolicy remotesigned"
                        - Type "Y" and hit Enter
                    - Retry ".\venv\Scripts\activate" in the VSCode terminal
